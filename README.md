# EyeFi Server 2 for Docker
Eye-Fi SD cards are designed to uploads pictures and videos from your digital camera to a computer, using wifi.
Initially these cards were designed to work with the manufacturer software, both on a local computer and on a cloud 
service.

Unfortunately the cloud service has been discontinued, then the manufacturer shut down; there is no longer an official 
support for the existing hardware.

Several projects filled the gap and allowed the cards to remain partially functional - See [Attribution below](#Attribution).
